# CLI-Tic-Tac-Toe
Quick little toy problem to build a tic-tac-toe game for the command line.

# How to play
Clone/Download the repo, navigate to the directory from your file path and then install dependancies using:
```
npm install
```
To play the game, simply run:
```
node game.js
```
You will be prompted to insert a location between 0-9 corresponding to a square on the board, player 'X' goes first, followed by player 'O' untill a player gets a straight line.

Have fun and feel free to reach out with any questions!
